🌍 Main Concepts in Terraform (with Brief Explanation)
1️⃣ Providers

👉 What it is:
Providers are plugins that let Terraform interact with cloud platforms (like AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) or services (like GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes).

🧠 Example:
The AWS provider allows Terraform to create AWS resources (EC2, S3, VPC, etc.).

provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}


💡 Think of providers as:

The “bridge” between Terraform and your cloud or service.

2️⃣ Resources

👉 What it is:
Resources are the actual infrastructure components that Terraform manages — such as servers, networks, and storage.

🧠 Example:
Creating an EC2 instance in AWS:

resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0dee22c13ea7a9a67"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}


💡 Think of resources as:

The “building blocks” — what Terraform actually creates in the cloud.

3️⃣ Variables

👉 What it is:
Variables make Terraform configurations reusable and flexible.
They allow you to pass dynamic values (e.g., instance size, region).

🧠 Example:

variable "instance_type" {
  default = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0dee22c13ea7a9a67"
  instance_type = var.instance_type
}


💡 Think of variables as:

“Inputs” that make your Terraform code more dynamic and maintainable.

4️⃣ Outputs

👉 What it is:
Outputs are used to display useful information after Terraform finishes execution — like instance IPs or resource IDs.

🧠 Example:

output "ec2_public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.my_ec2.public_ip
}


💡 Think of outputs as:

“Results” — the values you want to see after Terraform runs.

5️⃣ State File (terraform.tfstate)

👉 What it is:
Terraform keeps track of what it has created using a state file (terraform.tfstate).
This helps it know what exists in your infrastructure so it can apply only necessary changes.

🧠 Example:
If you change your EC2 instance type from t2.micro → t2.small, Terraform uses the state file to detect the change and update the instance.

💡 Think of the state as:

Terraform’s “memory” — it records what’s deployed in your cloud.

6️⃣ Plan & Apply

👉 What it is:
Terraform works in two phases:

terraform plan → Shows what changes will be made.

terraform apply → Actually makes those changes.

🧠 Example:

terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve


💡 Think of them as:

“Dry run” (plan) and “execute” (apply).

7️⃣ Modules

👉 What it is:
Modules are reusable sets of Terraform configurations that you can call from other Terraform files.

🧠 Example:

module "ec2_module" {
  source = "./modules/ec2"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}


💡 Think of modules as:

“Functions” in Terraform — reusable code blocks for your infrastructure.

8️⃣ Workspaces

👉 What it is:
Workspaces allow you to manage multiple environments (like dev, test, prod) using the same Terraform configuration.

🧠 Example:

terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace list


💡 Think of workspaces as:

“Separate folders” inside Terraform to manage different environments safely.

9️⃣ Provisioners

👉 What it is:
Provisioners are used to run scripts or commands on a resource after it’s created (like installing software on an EC2 instance).

🧠 Example:

provisioner "remote-exec" {
  inline = [
    "sudo apt-get update",
    "sudo apt-get install nginx -y"
  ]
}


💡 Think of provisioners as:

“Boot scripts” that configure your server after creation.

🔟 Backends

👉 What it is:
Backends define where Terraform stores its state file.
By default, it’s local (terraform.tfstate), but you can store it remotely (S3, Azure Storage, Terraform Cloud).

🧠 Example:

terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state"
    key    = "dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "ap-south-1"
  }
}
